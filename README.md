# Self-Esteem_Scale
The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is a self-esteem measure developed by the sociologist Morris Rosenberg in 1965. It is still used in social-science research today. To complete the measure, a person completes a survey that contains the following ten statements.  I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others. I feel that I have a number of good qualities. All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure. I am able to do things as well as most other people. I feel I do not have much to be proud of. I take a positive attitude toward myself. On the whole, I am satisfied with myself. I wish I could have more respect for myself. I certainly feel useless at times. At times I think I am no good at all. The person responds to each statement by choosing one of these four options: strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree. The person's response to each statement is worth 0â€“3 points, meaning the highest possible score is 10 * 3 = 30 points. If a person scores lower than 15 points, the person may have a problematic low self-esteem.
